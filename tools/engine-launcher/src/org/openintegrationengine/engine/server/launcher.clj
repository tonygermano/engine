;; File: launcher.clj
;; Purpose: Main entry point for the OIE Engine Launcher.
;;
;; This Clojure application acts as a sophisticated wrapper for launching a target Java application
;; (specifically, Mirth Connect Server, as indicated by hardcoded values).
;; Its primary responsibilities include:
;;   1. Parsing a `.vmoptions` file (`engine.vmoptions` by default) to gather JVM arguments.
;;   2. Supporting advanced features within the `.vmoptions` file, such as:
;;      - Environment variable substitution (e.g., `${VAR_NAME}`).
;;      - Including options from other files (`-include-options`).
;;      - Specifying the Java command path (`-java-cmd`).
;;      - Manipulating the classpath (`-classpath`, `-classpath/a`, `-classpath/p`).
;;   3. Determining the appropriate Java executable to use (respecting `-java-cmd`, JAVA_HOME, or system PATH).
;;   4. Constructing the final classpath, prepending the Mirth launcher JAR.
;;   5. Launching the target Java application as a separate process using ProcessBuilder.
;;   6. Managing the lifecycle of the child process, including a shutdown hook for graceful termination.
;;   7. Propagating the exit code of the child process.
;;
;; The code is structured to separate pure logic (parsing, command building) into helper functions
;; for testability, while the `-main` function orchestrates these helpers and handles side effects.

(defn substitute-env-vars
  "Substitutes `${VAR_NAME}` patterns within a given string `s`.

(defn- parse-vmoptions* ; Recursive internal implementation - see `parse-vmoptions` public API.
  "Recursively parses a vmoptions file and any files included via `-include-options`.
   Accumulates JVM options, classpath segments, the effective Java command path, and warnings.

   Parameters:
     - `file-path`: Path to the vmoptions file to parse.
     - `current-classpath`: The classpath string accumulated so far.
     - `current-java-cmd-path`: The java command path determined so far (last one wins).
     - `config`: A map containing functions for interacting with the environment,
                 enabling testability via dependency injection. Expected keys:
                   :read-file-fn :: String -> String (throws FileNotFoundException)
                   :getenv-fn :: String -> String | nil

                   :path-separator :: String (e.g., \":\" or \";\")

   Returns:
     A map describing the parsing result:
     { :ok?           boolean ; Indicates if parsing (including includes) succeeded without file errors.
       :options       [String] ; List of processed JVM options.
       :classpath     String   ; The fully constructed classpath string.
       :java-cmd-path String | nil ; The path specified by the *last* encountered -java-cmd, or nil.
       :warnings      [String] ; List of non-fatal issues encountered (e.g., included file not found).
       :error         Keyword | nil ; Keyword indicating fatal error type (e.g., :file-not-found) if ok? is false.
       :path          String | nil ; Path associated with the fatal error, if any.
